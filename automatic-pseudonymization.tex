\section{Automatic Pseudonymization}\label{sec:automatic-pseudonymization}
%
As state-of-the-art de-identification models do not rely on document coherency to identify \ac{phi}, we evaluate a naive word-level automatic pseudonymization approach to perturbing training data.
%
Before training, we replace all \ac{phi} tokens with a random choice of a fixed number $N$ of their neighbors in an embedding space, as determined by cosine distance in a pre-computed embedding matrix.

%
When using GloVe embeddings, only tokens that exist in the pre-computed embedding matrix are moved to their neighbors.
%
The unknown token is not modified as it does not contain any information (except that the token in question is not part of the precomputed matrix).

%
\cref{fig:auto-pseudo} shows the automatic pseudonymization experiment's results. 
%
For both FastText and GloVe, moving training \ac{phi} tokens to random tokens from up to their $N=200$ closest neighbors does not significantly reduce de-identification performance.
%
\fone scores for both models drop to around $95\%$ when selecting from $N=500$ neighbors and to around $90\%$ when using $N=1\,000$ neighbors.
%
With $N=100$, the FastText model achieves an \fone score of $96.75\%$ and the GloVe model achieves an \fone score of $96.42\%$.
%
The detailed evaluation tables for both FastText and GloVe can be found in \cref{app:baseline-evaluation}.

%
It is notable that models that were trained on automatically pseudonymized data outperform the corresponding model that was trained on raw data in \fone score in several categories of \ac{phi}.
%
The FastText model beats the respective raw data model in the profession, location, age and contact categories (see \cref{tab:detailed-mtn-fasttext}).
%
The automatic pseudonymization GloVe model outperforms the raw data model in the name, location, and date categories (see \cref{tab:detailed-mtn-glove}).
%
However, the overall binary \ac{hipaa} \fone scores do not improve when using automatic pseudonymization.

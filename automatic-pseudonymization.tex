\section{Automatic Pseudonymization}\label{sec:automatic-pseudonymization}
%
As state-of-the-art de-identification models do not rely on document coherency to identify \ac{phi}, we evaluate a naive word-level automatic pseudonymization approach to perturbing training data.
%
Before training, we replace all \ac{phi} tokens with a random choice of a fixed number $N$ of their neighbors in an embedding space, as determined by cosine distance in a pre-computed embedding matrix.

%
When using GloVe embeddings, only tokens that exist in the pre-computed embedding matrix are moved to their neighbors.
%
The unknown token is not modified as it does not contain any information (except that the token in question is not part of the precomputed matrix).

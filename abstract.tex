De-identification is the task of detecting \ac{phi} in medical text.
%
Obtaining a large and diverse dataset for de-identification poses a challenge as raw data cannot be shared due to privacy laws.
%
We introduce two approaches to sharing training data for de-identification that do not require expensive manual pseudonymization: a naive automatic pseudonymization and an adversarial private representation.
%
Both approaches allow training a basic de-identification model to the common target \fone score of $95\%$.

De-identification is the task of detecting \ac{phi} in medical text.
%
Automatic classifiers can significantly speed up the de-identification process.
%
However, obtaining a large and diverse dataset to train such a classifier poses a challenge as privacy laws prohibit sharing of raw medical records.
%
We introduce a method to create shareable representations of text (i.e.\ they contain no \ac{phi}) that does not require expensive manual pseudonymization. 
%
These representations can be shared between organizations to create unified datasets for training de-identification models.
%
Our representation allows training a simple \acs{lstm}-\acs{crf} de-identification model to an \fone score of $97.4\%$, which is comparable to a strong non-private baseline.

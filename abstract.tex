De-identification is the task of detecting \ac{phi} in medical text.
%
Obtaining a large and diverse dataset for de-identification poses a challenge as privacy laws prohibit sharing of raw medical records.
%
We introduce an adversarially learned private representation of medical text that does not require expensive manual pseudonymization and can be used to share training data for de-identification.
%
Our representation allows training a simple \acs{lstm}-\acs{crf} de-identification model to an \fone score of $97.4\%$, which is comparable to the non-private state of the art.
% TODO it's not really comparable, the SotA using ensemble+rules is 98.21
